## Geography

The world is a flat 2D world with possibly non orientable surfaces, like the desert areas.

There are four main regions, each centered around one of the four major trees. The four trees are the source of magic and centered around an elements: fire, water, air and earth.

Around each tree, the people living in that region have built their capitol city, the center of power and decision-making.

Further away from the capitol, in the direction of the the other regions, there are other cities, mostly relevant for defence and commerce with neighbouring societies.

The roots of the 4 major trees are actually interconnected and they form the nexus, which is like a series of gateways connecting distant regions. One may say that in our 3D world (with time), these roots are like the bridges of Einstein-Rosen.

The interfaces between these four different regions are desert. The deserts are a bit weird geographically and you need a map to navigate through them due to their non trivial topology.

At the very center of the desert, hence at the crossroads of all the four regions, the university rises. It is the only place where scholars are free to share all their knowledge with teh others. The university is a peaceful place.

## Geopolitics

Each of the civilisations living in one region (we may call them nations), has interests to destroy the others:
 1. to avoid being destroyed
 2. to expand their boundaries and collect more resources

Peace is also possible between regions, provided that civilizations agree to limit their growth and, instead of embracing capitalism, adopt a subsistence economy.

The fire nations is typically seen by the others as the bad guys, the air nations is generally seen as the nation of spies, while water and earth are usually considered to be made up of good and peacefule people.

Each nation is governed by their most powerful wizard, which is also named king. The more powerful people are in magic, the more their rank is high in society.

## The magic and skills system

All is centered around magic. Even physical prowess is related to magic ( a discipline of it). Magic is the essence of all life and of the game.

There are 8 magic disciplines, in pairs associated to one of the major trees.

1. Nature and ground manipulation
2. Physical strength and stamina enhancement
3. Air manipulation
4. Dexterity and speed enhancement
5. Water and Ice manipulation
6. Blood manipulation (to heal and to suck health)
7. Fire manipulation
8. Electricity manipulation

The first tow magic disciplines belong to the earth tree, the second two to the air tree, the third two to the water tree and the last to the fire tree.

## History (SPOILERS AHEAD DO NOT READ FURTHER)

The sneaky earth king is attacking the fire nation with subtle attacks to istigate them to react.

As soon as the fire nation react, the earth king blames them and allies with the water nation to destroy them.

The water nation is actually playing both sides, and as soon as the earth army is weakened, they start attacking the earth nation from a forgotten portal that lied in the ruined city of Karnack (one of the four cities that was once protecting the earth capital.

The attack of the water nation fails and also the fire tree is prevented from dying. All of this thanks to the player and the help of the air nation.

Ultimately, the player is named Arch-mage, rector of the university, guide of the entire world. As a sigil of faith, all king and the rector unite their magic to give birth to the 5th tree, the ether tree, at the core of the university.

The newborn ether tree is small and thus is not yet capable of creating new magic in the world.
